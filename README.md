# removeDuplicates
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. the result must be placed in the first part of the array nums.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
# maxProfit
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
# rotate
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
# reverseString
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
# reverseInt
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^(31), 2^(31-1)], then return 0.
# deleteNode
There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.
You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.
All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.
#removeNthFromEnd
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
