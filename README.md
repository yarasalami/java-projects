# removeDuplicates
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. the result must be placed in the first part of the array nums.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
# Divisible-by-3-and-is-also-an-even-numberr
Reads all the strings in the input, checks what is the hash value (https://www.asciitable.com/) of the first character in each of the strings , and if it is divisible by 3 and is also an even number, prints it (the character) on a separate line to the screen
# Example
for input : Before a E f                                                                                                                                                       
the output is :
