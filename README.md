# Divisible-by-3-and-is-also-an-even-numberr
Reads all the strings in the input, checks what is the hash value (https://www.asciitable.com/) of the first character in each of the strings , and if it is divisible by 3 and is also an even number, prints it (the character) on a separate line to the screen
for example, input : Before a E f                                                                                                                                                       
the output is :
